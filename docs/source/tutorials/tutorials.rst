Tutorials
=========

These tutorials explain blocks and dags, and how to use them to build applications.

The tutorial Python scripts are in the ``tutorials`` directory.
Open each tutorial script in your favourite editor so you can refer
to the code while reading the tutorial.

To run the tutorial scripts, open a command prompt in the ``tutorials`` directory
and run ``python tutorial_xx.py``.
